/**
 * @title  CreatorTokenTransferValidator
 * @author Limit Break, Inc.
 * @notice The CreatorTokenTransferValidator contract is designed to provide a customizable and secure transfer 
 *         validation mechanism for NFT collections. This contract allows the owner of an NFT collection to configure 
 *         the transfer security level, blacklisted accounts and codehashes, whitelisted accounts and codehashes, and
 *         authorized accounts and codehashes for each collection.
 *
 * @dev    <h4>Features</h4>
 *         - Transfer security levels: Provides different levels of transfer security, 
 *           from open transfers to completely restricted transfers.
 *         - Blacklist: Allows the owner of a collection to blacklist specific operator addresses or codehashes
 *           from executing transfers on behalf of others.
 *         - Whitelist: Allows the owner of a collection to whitelist specific operator addresses or codehashes
 *           permitted to execute transfers on behalf of others or send/receive tokens when otherwise disabled by 
 *           security policy.
 *         - Authorizers: Allows the owner of a collection to enable authorizer contracts, that can perform 
 *           authorization-based filtering of transfers.
 *
 * @dev    <h4>Benefits</h4>
 *         - Enhanced security: Allows creators to have more control over their NFT collections, ensuring the safety 
 *           and integrity of their assets.
 *         - Flexibility: Provides collection owners the ability to customize transfer rules as per their requirements.
 *         - Compliance: Facilitates compliance with regulations by enabling creators to restrict transfers based on 
 *           specific criteria.
 *
 * @dev    <h4>Intended Usage</h4>
 *         - The CreatorTokenTransferValidatorV3 contract is intended to be used by NFT collection owners to manage and 
 *           enforce transfer policies. This contract is integrated with the following varations of creator token 
 *           NFT contracts to validate transfers according to the defined security policies.
 *
 *           - ERC721-C:   Creator token implenting OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 standard.
 *           - ERC721-AC:  Creator token implenting Azuki's ERC-721A standard.
 *           - ERC721-CW:  Creator token implementing OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 standard with opt-in staking to 
 *                         wrap/upgrade a pre-existing ERC-721 collection.
 *           - ERC721-ACW: Creator token implementing Azuki's ERC721-A standard with opt-in staking to 
 *                         wrap/upgrade a pre-existing ERC-721 collection.
 *           - ERC1155-C:  Creator token implenting OpenZeppelin's ERC-1155 standard.
 *           - ERC1155-CW: Creator token implementing OpenZeppelin's ERC-1155 standard with opt-in staking to 
 *                         wrap/upgrade a pre-existing ERC-1155 collection.
 *
 *          <h4>Transfer Security Levels</h4>

 *          - Level 5: Only whitelisted accounts can initiate transfers, over-the-counter (OTC) trading enabled. 
 *                     Transfers to contracts with code are not allowed, unless present on the whitelist.
 *            - Caller Constraints: OperatorWhitelistEnableOTC
 *            - Receiver Constraints: NoCode
 *          - Level 6: Only whitelisted accounts can initiate transfers, over-the-counter (OTC) trading enabled.
